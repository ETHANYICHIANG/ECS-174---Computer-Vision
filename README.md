# ECS-174---Computer-Vision

This is a hw collection for ECS 174 @ UC Davis. Note: code in Matlab

## PS 1
### Description
This hw is about: content-aware image re-sizing. By calculating the engery function output of a image, we will be able to remove
a steam that has a lowest total energy when resizing. Please find the `Report.pdf` in PS1 for more detail.

## PS 2
### Description
This hw is about 2D image warping and creaeing mosaic images. Please find the `Report.pdf` in PS2 for more detail.

## PS 3
## Decsription
This hw is about pathern detection using `bag of words` and filters, 
also with a deep convolutional neural network to detect simlair sceen.
